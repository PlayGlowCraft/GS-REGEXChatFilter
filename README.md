# GS-REGEXChatFilter

This repository contains a regex-based filter list designed for use with [ChatFilter](https://modrinth.com/plugin/chat_filter).

---

ðŸ“„ **File Included**  
`GS-REGEXChatFilter.yml`: A curated list of regex rules to block offensive and obfuscated language in chat.

---

ðŸ“¥ **How to Use**  
This is a **preconfigured filter list**.  
Do **NOT** replace your entire configuration.

Instead, open your existing configuration and **copy and paste** the contents of `GS-REGEXChatFilter.yml` into the section where your regex rules are defined â€” typically under `categories:` in `filter.yml`.

After updating the file, **reload ChatFilter** or **restart your server** to apply the changes.
